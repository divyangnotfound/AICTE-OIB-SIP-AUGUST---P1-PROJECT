AICTE OIB SIP AUGUST - P1 PROJECT

Welcome to my project repository for the AICTE-OIB-SIP August Internship, where I have successfully completed 3 foundational Data Science tasks as part of the internship program.

-->Overview

This repository includes three mini-projects, each focused on solving real-world problems using data science techniques. The tasks helped enhance my skills in data preprocessing, visualization, exploratory data analysis (EDA), and model building.

-->Completed Tasks
1. IRIS Flower Classification

Objective: Classify different species of Iris flowers based on petal and sepal dimensions.

Skills Applied: Supervised learning, classification algorithms, data visualization.

Tools Used: Python, Pandas, Seaborn, Matplotlib, Scikit-learn.

2. Unemployment Analysis due to COVID-19

Objective: Analyze how the COVID-19 pandemic impacted unemployment across different regions in India.

Skills Applied: Data cleaning, grouping, time series visualization, regional analysis.

Tools Used: Pandas, Seaborn, Matplotlib.

3. Sales Prediction

Objective: Predict future sales based on advertising spend across various channels (TV, Radio, Newspaper).

Skills Applied: Correlation analysis, regression modeling, outlier handling.

Tools Used: Pandas, Seaborn, Matplotlib, Scikit-learn.

--> Technologies Used

Python

Jupyter Notebook

Pandas, NumPy

Matplotlib, Seaborn

Scikit-learn
